# Making Pixel Art with Deep Unsupervised Learning
Project developed for _School in AI: Deep Learning, Vision and Language for Industry, UNIMORE._

<p align='justify'>Pixel art is a form of digital art in which images are identified by a specific visual style, where image is subsampled in a number of blocks, aka "pixels". It is often associated with the low resolution graphics present in old computers and in 8-bit and 16-bit video games. Although creating pixel art from an input image may seem like a trivial task to perform by some algorithm, the results are always disappointing in an artistic sense (pixel artists can create way more clean pictures). The purpose of this report is to automate the creation of pixel art from existing images more artistically with the help of deep learning techniques framed as part of the style-transfer, followed by post-processing performed with image algorithms processing in Python.</p>
